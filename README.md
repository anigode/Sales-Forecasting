# Sales-Forecasting
## Introduction
This project focuses on E-commerce Sales Forecasting using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance, discount effectiveness, customer segmentation, and marketing impact. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales trends, revenue distribution, and forecasting insights, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Usage
- Load the Dataset into Power BI.
- Explore Key Metrics such as revenue, units sold, discount impact, and customer segmentation.
- Utilize Interactive Visuals like line charts, bar graphs, and correlation heatmaps to uncover trends.
- Filter Data using slicers for date ranges, discount percentages, and customer segments.
- Customize the Dashboard by integrating additional KPIs or business-specific metrics.

## Data
The dataset includes transactional sales data with the following attributes:
- Date: The transaction date.
- Product Category: Categories like Electronics, Fashion, Home Decor, etc.
- Units Sold: Total items sold per transaction.
- Revenue: Total sales revenue generated.
- Discount: Percentage of discount applied.
- Marketing Spend: Advertising and promotional investments.
- Customer Segment: Regular, Occasional, and Premium buyers.

## Data Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning: Ensured uniformity in date formats, category labels, and missing values.
- Feature Engineering: Created discount brackets (e.g., 0-10%, 11-20%, 21-30%) for better analysis.
- Segmentation: Classified customers based on purchase frequency and spending patterns.

## Dashboard Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes the following insights:
1. Effect of Discounts on Sales & Revenue
A line graph showing how different discount percentages influence sales volume and revenue.

2. Top-Selling Product Categories
A bar chart displaying the highest-grossing product categories in terms of revenue and sales volume.

3. Sales Volume & Revenue Overview
Key performance indicators (KPIs) showing total sales volume and revenue figures.

4. Monthly Sales Trends
A time series graph illustrating revenue trends across different months.

5. Customer Segments Revenue Contribution
A pie chart depicting the revenue distribution among Regular, Occasional, and Premium customers.

6. Marketing Spend vs. Revenue Correlation
A heatmap highlighting the relationship between marketing expenditure and revenue generation.

## Insights
- Discount Influence: Moderate discounts (21-30%) result in higher sales volume, but extreme discounts (31-40%) do not significantly increase revenue.
- Top Product Categories: Sports and Electronics drive the highest revenue, followed by Toys, Fashion, and Home Decor.
- Sales Seasonality: Sales peak in mid-year months (June-August) and dip towards the end of the year.
- Customer Segmentation: Premium customers contribute the highest revenue share, followed by Regular and Occasional buyers.
- Marketing Efficiency: Marketing spend has a strong correlation with revenue, especially in Electronics and Fashion categories.

## Tools and Skills Utilized
- Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Data Transformation: Cleaning and processing sales data.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for custom calculations.
- Slicers & Filters: Enabling interactive data exploration.
- Correlation Analysis: Understanding the impact of marketing investments.

## Conclusion
This E-commerce Sales Forecasting project showcases how Power BI can be leveraged to analyze and predict sales trends. The dashboard provides actionable insights that help businesses optimize marketing strategies, set competitive discounts, and enhance customer targeting. Continuous improvement and additional datasets can further refine predictive accuracy.

## Future Enhancements
